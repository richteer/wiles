# Fermat
A compiler for CS445: Compiler Construction.

## Dependencies
- a C compiler
- a lex equivalent (flex)
- a yacc equivalent (bison)
- tolerance for terrible error messages

Be sure to set CC, LEX, and YACC in the Makefile to match your appropriate utilities.

## Usage
Source text is inputted on `stdin` (likely to change in the future).
The optional `-v` flag can be used to display the scanning/parsing magic.
In fact, without it, it does basically nothing.
